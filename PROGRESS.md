## Phase 3: local-first design and whiteboard tool

Goal: grow paper-rs into a Paper / Figma / Excalidraw-class tool. Figma and Paper are studied
clean-room (behavior only, `analysis/FIGMA_NOTES.md`, `analysis/PAPER_ARCHITECTURE.md`).
Excalidraw is MIT and studied from source (`analysis/EXCALIDRAW_NOTES.md`); ported algorithms
are credited in `THIRD_PARTY.md`.

### P5 notes

* **Inspector**: grouped macOS-style sections (header actions, alignment icons, position &
  size with per-corner radii, constraints / sizing, auto layout, text, fills with gradients
  and images, stroke, layer blend/opacity, hand-drawn, arrow, sticky). Number fields scrub
  and coalesce into one undo step; edits inside instances become overrides.
* **Layers tree**: drag rows to reorder — above / below a row, or into a frame or group (the
  middle of the row); the canvas position is kept and the move is one undo step.
* **Command palette** (⌘K, also ⌘⇧/): fuzzy search over every bound action, all tools, pages,
  library items and layers (select + zoom). Arrow keys, Enter, Esc.
* **Shortcuts**: one binding table drives dispatch, the grouped help panel (⌘/ or ?), the egui
  menu bar and the native macOS menu (⌘ chords become key equivalents; single keys are
  shown in titles). Added Tab/⇧Tab sibling selection, ⇧Enter parent, ⇧H/⇧V flip,
  ⌘⌥C/⌘⌥V copy/paste properties, ⌥-drag duplicate (one undo step), PageUp/PageDown pages,
  ⌘R rename, ⌘\ hide UI, ⇧0 zoom 100%, Excalidraw number keys. 100+ bindings, checked for
  conflicts by a test.
* Deferred: Figma's number-key opacity (the digits pick tools, as in Excalidraw), drag of
  multiple layers at once in the tree, customizable shortcuts.

### P4 notes

* **rough.js 4.6.4 port** (`render/rough.rs`): RNG, lines, curves, ellipses, SVG paths, solid,
  hachure, cross-hatch, zigzag and dots fills, plus Excalidraw's element → options mapping
  (`adjustRoughness`, dash patterns, fill weight, hachure gap). The test compares ten
  generator calls against real rough.js output (`tests/fixtures/rough/`, produced by
  running the MIT library under Node) to 1e-6, so the same seed draws the same wobble.
  Per-node toggle (⌘⌥H or the inspector), sloppiness 0/1/2, fill style, re-roll seed; with
  nothing selected the toggle sets the default for new shapes.
* **Arrows** (`connector.rs`): a `Connector` node with start/end bindings (`node`, normalized
  fixed point, inside/orbit). Orbit ends stop at the target outline + `5 + stroke/2`, aimed
  at the other end's focus, and re-route in the fixup pass whenever a bound layer (or an
  ancestor) moves, resizes or is deleted. Straight, curved (Catmull-Rom) and elbow routes;
  elbow uses a grid + A* with Excalidraw's bend penalty and segment-count heuristic.
  Heads: arrow, triangle, dot, bar, diamond. Endpoint handles rebind; the midpoint handle
  bends. Labels on shapes defer to the shape when binding.
* **Quick diagram shapes**: diamond tool (D), polygon/star, and quick-connect "+" knobs on a
  selected shape that duplicate it 80 px away and connect the two with a bound arrow.
* **Sticky notes** (S): colored note with padding 16, text wraps and the font shrinks
  (to 12) to fit, six colors.
* **Laser pointer** (K): a trail that fades over 1 s and shows the last 50 points, eased like
  Excalidraw; the event loop animates only while points are visible, then idles.
* **Library**: a shared `library.json` in the projects folder (starter flowchart items on
  first use), a Library tab with tessellated previews, add-selection, rename, remove, insert
  (fresh ids, arrow bindings and instance links remapped).
* Number keys 1–0 select tools like Excalidraw (1 select … 0 eraser).
* Deferred depth: Excalidraw's dynamic-AABB "side hack" in elbow routing, arrow labels and
  text bound inside shapes, multi-point arrows by clicking, freedraw with perfect-freehand
  (paper-rs keeps its own ink), rough rendering of text/ink, collaboration.

### P3 notes

* **Renderer rework.** Nodes become backend-neutral draw ops (fills with solid / linear /
  radial / image paints, strokes, glyph runs) in `render/draw.rs`. The GPU path tessellates
  them in world space and caches per node (keyed by content, world rect, inherited opacity and
  zoom octave). Unchanged frames reuse the item list; the world vertex buffer is only
  re-uploaded when the item list changes, so panning costs one uniform write. Gradients use a
  ramp atlas; images are mipmapped textures; multiply/screen/darken/lighten have their own
  blend pipelines (premultiplied output). The SVG exporter consumes the same ops.
* **Model v3**: fill layers, blend, stroke align/dash/caps/joins, per-corner radii, rich text
  spans, auto layout, layout-child sizing and constraints, component flag and instance links,
  groups, vector paths, polygons, stars. Page format v3 with a v2→v3 migration (`fill` →
  `fills`).
* **Fixup pass** (`Editor::fixup`) runs inside every transaction: normalizes group bounds,
  syncs instances of edited components (respecting per-property overrides recorded by the
  inspector, text edits and drags), and re-runs auto layout from the outermost auto-layout
  ancestor. It undoes together with the edit.
* **Resize** restores the drag-start snapshot each move and re-applies constraints/group
  scaling from it, so repeated resizes never drift.
* **10k elements**: `tests/perf.rs` builds 10 000 nodes (rects, ellipses, stars, text), all in
  view. Release: first frame ~140 ms (CPU tessellation of everything), cached frame ~3 ms,
  editing one node re-tessellates one node, panning re-uploads nothing.
* Deferred depth: rounded-corner frame clipping, live (non-destructive) booleans, on-canvas
  gradient handles, rotation, variants, layout grids, min/max sizes, baseline alignment, and
  exact GPU compositing for the remaining 11 blend modes and group opacity.

### P2 notes

* Each page is its own infinite canvas with its own undo history, selection and camera. The
  active page lives in the editor; the others are parked in their slot (`PageStash`).
* Pages panel at the top of the left sidebar: click to switch, + to add, double-click to rename,
  right-click for Rename / Duplicate / Delete, drag to reorder. The last page can't be deleted.
* Paste on another page (or in another project) keeps the original position; paste on the same
  page offsets by 16 px.
* Deleting a page isn't undoable (the page file is removed at the next save).

### P1 notes

* Projects live in `~/Documents/paper-rs/<name>/` (`PAPER_RS_HOME` overrides): `project.json`
  (manifest: id, name, created/modified, ordered pages, active page), `pages/<id>.json`, and
  `thumbnail.png`. Deleting moves the folder to `.trash/` with a `trashinfo.json`, restorable from
  the Trash view.
* Every write is temp file + fsync + rename + directory fsync (`io::atomic`). Stale temp files
  from a crash are removed when the project opens.
* Formats carry `format` + `version`; loading runs a chain of `Value -> Value` migrations.
  paper-rs 0.1 `.paper-rs` files are page format v1 and migrate to v2 (tested).
* Autosave: changes are written 1 s after the first unsaved edit (bounded latency even while
  editing, never during a drag), on page switch, when leaving the project and on quit. The event
  loop sleeps until the autosave deadline, so idle CPU stays at zero. Thumbnails refresh at most
  every 20 s and when leaving the project.
* Known gap: typing inside an open text edit is saved when the edit ends (it is one undo step).

## Verification log

* `cargo build --release` passes with no warnings. `cargo clippy --all-targets` is clean.
* `cargo test` runs 51 unit/scenario tests and 8 headless GPU tests, all passing. The GPU tests
  ran on Mesa lavapipe (llvmpipe, Vulkan) on the headless VPS.
* The real windowed app was launched under Xvfb (X11) with the release binary and screenshotted.
  It needed `libxkbcommon-x11` and `libxcb-xkb` placed in `~/.local/lib`, since the VPS has no
  root access.
* `cargo check --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin` and `--target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
  both pass.
* The SVG export was rasterized with resvg and compared with the GPU PNG export: 0.004% of
  pixels differ.

## Notes

* Commit history: the core model, the editor and the app/renderer/I/O layer landed as three
  feature commits. Each one builds in release mode and has its own tests. Milestones 1–7 are
  spread across them because the layers depend on each other: the app needs I/O, and the
  overlay needs the editor.
* REA's full-asar analysis stalled on `node_modules/typescript/lib/_tsc.js` after 20+ minutes
  at 2.6 GB RSS. A scoped run on Paper's own sources finished in 65 s.

## Next steps (not started)

1. Image nodes (textured quads) and drag-and-drop of image files, to match `paper-asset:`.
2. Per-node mesh cache keyed by revision and zoom bucket.
3. Rotation, plus a bezier pen tool.
4. Multiple pages, and system clipboard interop (SVG/PNG/text).
5. Run and tune on macOS hardware, especially trackpad scroll feel and tablet pressure.
